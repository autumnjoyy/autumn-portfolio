        I’ve taught myself how to build a live portfolio website from scratch —
        with zero prior experience. I learned to use tools like React, Tailwind CSS, GitHub, and Vercel,
        and with the help of AI guidance, I’ve written all the code myself. From designing a homepage
        and adding resume content, to setting up navigation and pushing changes live, I’ve done it all
        hands-on — learning through trial, error, and creativity.
